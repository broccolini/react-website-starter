# React Website Starter
Simple setup for websites built in React with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) ðŸ’…,  [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system/) ðŸ’™, and [x0](https://github.com/c8r/x0) ðŸ˜Ž.

Check out the [demo branch](https://github.com/broccolini/react-website-starter/tree/demo) to see example components with various different methods of applying styles.

## Getting started

Install all the things with:

`npm install`

Run app with:

`npm start`

Build app with:

`npm run build`

## Development and publishing

This repo uses [x0 by Compositor](https://github.com/c8r/x0) to give you a zero-config React development environment and static site generator. This lets you get up and running quickly so you can focus on building your components, designing your website, and choosing how you want to handle styles.

By default the build script will create an `index.html` file in the root directory, if you like you can publish this via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

See the x0 docs for other configuration options such rendering JS bundles, changing the build directory, and using with [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).
